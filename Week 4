I recently went out with some friends and we wanted to buy some drinks and food  but it was late in the evening. Using the map app on our phones we had to check every store, and see if they were still opened. This took us time. My idea is to create an interactive map, where instead of checking each store to see if it is open, the map would only recommend the shops that are still opened. This way, by just opening the map, we would directly see which store to go to.
The data that would be required is the list of all the stores of a city, we will pick Paris for this project. Foursquare provides the opening hours of every store, and their location. The map will change during time. So for example, if I wake up early and I want to go to a bakery to buy me some croissants, I won't have to check every bakery in Paris and see which are opened, I will directly see it thanks to the evolving map.
